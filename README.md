# Final

This repository serves as a starter template for building React applications using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It includes essential configurations for ESLint to maintain code quality and consistency.

## Features

* **React + Vite**: Leverages Vite's fast bundling and hot module replacement (HMR) for efficient development.
* **ESLint Integration**: Pre-configured ESLint setup to enforce coding standards.
* **Minimal Setup**: Provides a clean slate to start building your React application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/namdinh2008/Final.git
   cd Final
   ```



2. **Install dependencies**:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```



Or using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```



### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```



This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```



This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

### Previewing the Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```



This will serve the production build locally for previewing.([stackoverflow.com][1])
